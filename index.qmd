I am James Mitchell-White, a scientist from the UK. I have worked as a biochemist, and you may be interested in my [published works](papers/index.qmd). My research focuses on the dynamics of membrane proteins, starting with the use of models for the folding of Î±-helical membrane proteins, and moving on to the transport mechanism of membrane transporters.

I used to have a lot of hobbies, now I just have a kid. I can't help but play around with a few side projects though, and I'm starting to put some of them [here](data-analysis/index.qmd).

If you find any of this interesting and have questions this site doesn't answer, please get in touch!
