This is a partner paper to the [other sensory rhodopsin paper](pSRII_abs.qmd). Yi-Lei was an experimental powerhouse for these papers, and the manuscript goes through the results in extraordinary detail. In my thesis, I used PCA to show that the general trends in chemical shift changes could be related to the concentration of SDS used, but this didn't make it into the paper.
