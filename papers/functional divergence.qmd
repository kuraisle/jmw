While I was helping to write [this review](ABCG%20review.qmd), I was given a section to write looking at the sequence differences between ABCG2 and ABCG5/G8. Normally I would just have aligned the sequences, had a look at some likely spots for functional differences and left it there. As it was lockdown, I had the time to think about the question more deeply. If you just align two sequences, any differences you see might just be normal, random variation. However, if you align a lot of sequences, you can start to make better inferences about what the differences might mean.
The ABCG family of mammalian ATP-binding cassete proteins has five members with different functions.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ABCG1 | Cholesterol transport | Homodimer, but will dimerize with |
| ABCG2 | Multidrug transport | Homodimer, but will dimerize with |
| ABCG4 | Cholesterol transport | Homodimer, but will dimerize with |
| ABCG5 | Bile acid transport | Obligate heterodimer with ABCG8 |
| ABCG8 | Bile acid transport | Obligate heterodimer with ABCG5 |

The difference I'm most interested in is that most of the family binds a pretty narrow category of molecules: sterol-like lipids. ABCG2, which I was working on at the time, transports a wide range of different molecules, which we call a broad substrate specificity.
