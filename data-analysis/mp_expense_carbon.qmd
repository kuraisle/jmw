*This is a work in progress. I need to finish converting trips to carbon consumption!*

## An example - Hey big spender!
Here we're going to look at the carbon footprint of the travel UK Members of Parliament (MPs) have put on their expenses. First, we will get the data for MPs' expenses from [IPSA](https://www.theipsa.org.uk/). I'll be looking at the data from the year 2022-2023, as this is the last complete year of data as of 21/11/2023.

Here are the top 30 spenders, by the amount paid for their travel.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mp_data: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_csv("data/individualBusinessCosts_22_23.csv", low_memory=False)
travel_tags: list[str] = ['Dependant Travel', 'MP Travel', 'Staff Travel']
travel_data: pd.DataFrame = mp_data[mp_data['Category'].isin(travel_tags)][['Name', 'Category', 'Cost Type', 'Short Description', 'Details', 'Journey Type', 'From', 'To', 'Travel', 'Nights', 'Mileage', 'Amount Claimed', 'Amount Paid', 'Amount Not Paid', 'Amount Repaid']]
total_paid = travel_data[['Name', 'Amount Paid']].groupby('Name').sum().sort_values(by='Amount Paid', ascending=False)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = [8,8])
total_paid.iloc[:30].plot(kind='bar', ax=ax)
plt.ylabel("Total Travel Expenses (£)")
plt.xticks(rotation = 60, ha = "right")
plt.legend([],[])
plt.show()
```

Phew, Steven Bonnar spent nearly £60,000 on travel.

```{python}
bonnar_cost_split = travel_data.loc[travel_data['Name'] == 'Steven Bonnar'][['Cost Type', 'Amount Paid']].groupby('Cost Type').sum()
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.pie(x = bonnar_cost_split['Amount Paid'],
       labels = bonnar_cost_split.index,
       labeldistance=None
    )
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor = (1.1, 0.8))

plt.show()
```

A lot of this was spent on air travel. Steven Bonnar is the Scottish National Party (SNP) MP for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill.

```{python}
bonnar_flights = (travel_data
    .loc[(travel_data['Name'] == 'Steven Bonnar') & (travel_data['Cost Type'] == 'Air travel')][['From', 'To']]
    .groupby(by=['From', 'To'], group_keys='Total Flights')
    .size()
    .reset_index(name = 'Number of Trips')
    )
bonnar_flights.set_index(['From', 'To'], inplace=True)
bonnar_flights
```

You can see that all of this is him flying from Glasgow, where his constituency is, to London, for Parliament.
A Glasgow to London flight takes about an hour and a half. The train takes four and a half hours.

```{python}
pd.DataFrame({
    'Journey': ['GLA-LCY', 'GLA-LHR', 'GLA-LGW', 'GLA-STN','Glasgow-Euston'],
    'Vehicle': [*['Aeroplane']*4, 'Train'],
    'Time (hours)': [1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.3, 4.5],
    'Estimated CO2 (kg)': [101.2, 68.5, 81.4, 75.6, 24.57],
    'Distance to parliament (km)': [9.5 , 16.7, 27.1, 41.2, 2.4]
}).set_index('Journey')
```

Is this all fair enough then? The honourable member would save up to three hours and ten minutes per trip going by air, right? Getting through the airport takes at least an hour, though, and London Euston is a lot closer to Parliament than, for example, Stansted, shrinking the time advantage.

Let's have an estimate of the carbon emissions of these trips then.
```{python}
bonnar_flights['Emissions per flight (kg CO2)'] = [101.2, 68.5, 75.6, 101.2, 81.4, 68.5]
bonnar_flights['Total emissions (kg CO2)'] = bonnar_flights['Number of Trips'] * bonnar_flights['Emissions per flight (kg CO2)']
bonnar_flights
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
from IPython.display import Markdown
bonnar_tons = bonnar_flights['Total emissions (kg CO2)'].sum()/1000
Markdown(
        f"From this we can see that the total emissions from Steven Bonnar's flights is 10.3275 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. Given an estimate of the average total emissions of a UK resident is [11.7 tons](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/the-average-british-carbon-footprint-is-five-times-over-paris-agreement-recommendations/152669/#:~:text=Recent%20research%20finds%20that%20an,equivalent%20(tCO2e)%20per%20year.), you might wonder if it might be better to take the train."
)
```

## The point of the exercise
All this isn't just to bash poor Steven Bonnar, against whom I have no particular grudge. It's always going to be tricky commuting from Glasgow to London. I do think, however, we should look at how much damage to the environment the UK taxpayer is paying for. Here, I'll be estimating the emissions for each taxpayer-funded trip, then breaking down the dataset to see if anyone could be doing better.

### Estimating emissions
How do you estimate emissions from travel then? For some modes of transport, it's fairly straightforward - there's a particular value per kilometre, and we assume everything else evens out.

What kinds of expenses are people claiming then?
```{python}
pd.DataFrame(travel_data['Cost Type'].unique())
```

Some of these we will discard. We aren't looking at the emissions of staying in a hotel, because it would be too hard to estimate, and not meaningful to look at here. Other things like railcards and congestion charges don't have a meaningful emissions figure.

I am curious as to what someone is claiming as the mileage on their bicycle, though. New tyres? Protein bars?
